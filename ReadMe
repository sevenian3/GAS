  Python version of Phil Bennett's GAS chemical equilibrium code
    Ian Short

  Main methods are in either GsTest or GsCalc - run either of these to run whole package
    - GsTest - quick test run at one temperature (t) value
    - GsCalc - loops over temperatures and writes partial pressures (PPs) to output file
    --- for either: input parameters all set by hand in code

  Imports custom python ports of dgefa and dgesl from subdirectory linpack
   and of daxpy, dscal and idamax from subdrectory blas - all part of distribution 

  Input files:  Expects "fort.4" in main directory
    - of form of gas.d or gas.data from Phil

  Output files:  Written in Outputs/ - this subdirectory must already exist in the run directory
   - file name of form GsCalcpt[PT value]is[ISOLV value]
   - extension *.out - report for human readers
   - extension *.2.out - input for GsPlot 

  Plotting:
  GsPlot - stand alone main method to read in output file *.2.out from GsCalc and to
make a plot in the python IDE of the form of those in Phil Bennett's M.Sc. thesis,
for one species at a time (for now).
   - input filename stem set by hand in code 
   - choice of species set by hand in code
